# Personal dotfiles

- **Terminal**: [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)
- **Shell**: zsh
    - **Additions**: Oh My Zsh, [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)
- **Command-line editor**: Neovim
    - **Additions**: Vim plugged, Conqueror of Completion (COC) (requires Node.js & npm)

## Setup

[setup.sh](setup.sh) is a work-in-progress. For now, copy all dotfiles to your home directory (~/).

setup.sh is intended to function as a quick means to make a base install of Arch Linux
compatible with my current workflow. It __will__ overwrite any of your existing dotfiles,
so I suggest that you backup your .config/ and .zshrc file/directory so you don't lose
your current setup.
